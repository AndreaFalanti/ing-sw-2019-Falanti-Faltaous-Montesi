1. Check if Gson actually cares about default constructors
2. Try to streamline selections in weapon behaviour
3. Create EffectInfo class to separate model from controller
4. Use logging inside PickExpression class
5. Implement better version of XorEffect that does not use EffectInfo
    NB. this is because EffectInfo has additional information that are useless to
        XorEffect (priority and optionality)
6. Build the MWEL
